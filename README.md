# Financial Analysis and Chatbot Project  

## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing financial data from major companies (Apple, Microsoft, Tesla) and making the insights accessible through a chatbot interface. The project involves:  
-
 Data Compilation:

I created an Excel sheet compiling key financial metrics—Total Revenue, Net Income, and Total Assets—for the last three financial years for companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla.

 
 
 Data Analysis in Python:

Using Jupyter Notebook, I imported the dataset and analyzed it further:


Created new columns to calculate Revenue Growth and Net Income Growth for each company.
Gained insights into financial trends over the years.


Chatbot Development:
To make this data more accessible, I developed a chatbot that enables users to query the financial metrics and trends effortlessly.

This project showcased my skills in:

 Excel for data organization.
 
 Python (Pandas, Jupyter Notebook) for data analysis and visualization.
 
Chatbot development to enhance user interaction
